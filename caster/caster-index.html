                            Before this project I had been learning Unity for a while, but had only built a few small projects 
                            that were geared towards a specific aspect of Unity (such as animation, player movement, sound, UI, etc.). 
                            I really wanted to develop something that was a more comprehensive experience that would combine
                            many things I had learned up until that point. I also really love old school first person shooters like Doom,
                            Duke Nukem 3D, Goldeneye 007, and Perfect Dark. This demo uses animation, music, sound effects, player and camera movement, Enemy AI, interactable objects, 
                            UI, and a level objective system. For this project I really wanted to replicate just about every aspect
                            of an old school FPS.
