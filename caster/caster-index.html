                        <td>
                            Before this project, I had been learning Unity for a while and had only built a few small projects 
                            that were geared toward a specific aspect of Unity (animation, player movement, sound, UI, etc.). 
                            I wanted to challenge myself by developing a more comprehensive experience that would combine many things 
                            I had learned up until that point. I also really love old-school first-person shooters like Doom, Duke 
                            Nukem 3D, Goldeneye 007, and Perfect Dark. This demo uses animation, music, sound effects, player movement, camera 
                            movement, Enemy AI, interactable objects, UI, and a level objective system. The goal I set out to achieve for this
                            project was to replicate almost every aspect of an old-school FPS.
