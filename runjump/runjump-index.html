                            This game was developed as my semester 6 Software Development Capstone project. It is an endless 
                            runner-style game similar to Flappy Bird. However, from a top-down perspective, such as a 2d Zelda game, instead 
                            of a side-scroller perspective. The player dodges and jumps over obstacles/enemies to earn points. 
                            If the player hits an obstacle/enemy, they lose the game and will have to try again. The player can 
                            collect coins to buy items that help them survive longer and get higher scores. The game tracks 
                            statistics about the player such as highest score, total coins collected, and average life. 
                            
                            NOTE: After not being used for a bit the high-score server endpoint can take up to 30 seconds to 
                            spin up. This can cause a failed connection message when trying to view high scores or upload a new high score.
